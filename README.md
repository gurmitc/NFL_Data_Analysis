# NFL Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze historical betting data from the NFL to create insights and trends that inform betting strategies. By using statistical analysis, we seek to identify patterns in performance, betting, and outcomes to provide actionable insights for users.

## Objectives
**Data Collection:** Gather/scrape comprehensive datasets including historical game results and betting odds

**Data Cleaning:** Prepare the data for analysis by unifying data formats, and maintaining relevant columns

**Statistical Data Analysis:** Conduct statistical analysis to visualize trends in betting, team performance, and the relationship between odds and game outcomes

**Strategy Development:** Formulate betting strategies based on historical insights

## Methodology
- Utilize Python (specifically Pandas) and Tableau for data scraping, data analysis, and data visualization

- Create a section of code that takes inputs (conditions, results, stats) and provides a look at trends in historical data

- Displays trends based on historica game statistics, as well as subsequent results

- Insights for bettors aimed at improving their chances of success in NFL betting

## Impact
By providing analysis of NFL betting data, this project will provide bettors with the tools and insights to make informed decisions, ultimately enhancing their betting experience and potential profitability

## Example Trend
